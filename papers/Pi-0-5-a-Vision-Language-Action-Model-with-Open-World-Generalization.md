Fig. 3: Model overview. pi0.5 is trained in two stages. First, a pre-training stage combines all of the different data sources to produce an initial VLA with
discrete tokens. This stage uses data from diverse robotic platforms, high-level semantic action prediction, and data from the web. Robotic data uses the FAST
action tokenizer to represent actions as discrete tokens [64]. Second, a post-training stage specializes the model for low-level and high-level inferences for
mobile manipulation, leveraging the most task-relevant data, including verbal instructions from human supervisors. This stage uses flow matching to represent
the action distribution, enabling efficient real-time inference and the ability to represent fine-grained continuous action sequences. At inference time, the model
